#A beginer's racing game
##It's called Wario Shart: Tripple Smasg
I created a very basic racing game using PYGAME. It is a two player game. I was having trouble with coding a finish line, so the first person to hit an obstical loses.
*WASD for player one
*Arrow keys for player two
*Q to quit
*R to play agian
